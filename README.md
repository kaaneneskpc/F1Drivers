# F1Drivers

This app about F1 Drivers.
An application showing Formula 1 drivers using ListView.Clicking on driver goes to the detail activity and displays the image.
2 separate image calls were used, the classic and the more efficient.
Companion object structure, similar to singleton structure in classical structure, was used.

## Companion Object

Unlike Java or C#, Kotlin doesn’t have static members or member functions. Kotlin recommends to simply use package-level functions instead.
If you need to write a function that can be called without having a class instance but needs access to the internals of a class, you can write it as a member of a companion object declaration inside that class. 
By declaring a companion object inside our class, you’ll be able to call its members with the same syntax as calling static methods in Java/C#, 
using only the class name as a qualifier.
